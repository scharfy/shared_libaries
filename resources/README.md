# Non-Groovy files can be stored in this directory. They can be loaded via the libraryResource step in an external library.
# This is intended for allowing your external libraries to load up any additional non-Groovy files they may need. An example could be a datafile of some kind, such as an XML or JSON file, or any other file that the library needs to use. The file is loaded as a string.
